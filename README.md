Larvel 4 Sublime Text 2 Snippets
===
This is a collection of snippets that aim's to make developing for Laravel even easier. It's basically just a map of commonly use laravel classes.

I forked this from a repo with L3 snippets, so some of the old snippets should still be correct, but I will be changing the incorrect ones as I find conflicts.


Installation
---
It's very simple to install. All you have to do is to move this folder in to your packages folder:

	~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/
	
This remains to be setup with Sublime Text Packages, but hopefully will be in the future in order to make it even easier to install.
